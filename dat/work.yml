    Volition is an innovative brand out to change the beauty industry. Unlike traditional companies, Volition was born out of the idea that customers have the right to drive product decisions while knowing what is in their products, how much it costs to make them, and where they are made. All product ideas and decisions are entirely crowd sourced.
    In branding Volition Beauty, Designsake Studio developed the logo, patterns, icons, website, and product packaging with the intent of highlighting the company's core values of transparency, prestige quality, innovation, and community.
