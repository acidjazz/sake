  meta: BATCH & BATTER Artisan waffle ice-cream sandwiches made with organic ingredients and available by food truck throughout San Francisco, California.
  description: |
    Batch & Batter creates artisan waffle ice cream sandwiches using locally sourced, organic ingredients. Each sandwich is made with two scoops of small batch ice cream ranging in a variety of unique flavors and sandwiched between freshly made waffles. And the best part: these sandwiches are made to order in a food truck that makes appearances all over San Francisco.
    The goals in creating Batch & Batter’s identity and product packaging were to highlight the transparency of ingredients, the artisan quality behind their sandwiches, and lastly, delivering a nostalgic experience similar to that of being a child ordering from an ice cream truck.
